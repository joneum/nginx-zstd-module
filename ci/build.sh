# Build an nginx that carries the two modules of this repository.  The
# continuous integration workflow runs this, and so can you:
#
#     ci/build.sh 1.31.6 /tmp/nginx-test
#     TEST_NGINX_BINARY=/tmp/nginx-test/sbin/nginx prove -r t/
#
# usage: ci/build.sh <nginx version> <install prefix> [mode]
#
#     static    both modules built into the binary (the default)
#     dynamic   both modules built as loadable objects
#
# nginx lands in $CI_WORK, ./ci-work by default, and is reused on a
# second run.  A warning from this module's own sources fails the build.
#
# ZSTD_INC and ZSTD_LIB are passed through if they are set.  On a system
# that keeps zstd under /usr/local, FreeBSD among them, the module finds
# it on its own.
